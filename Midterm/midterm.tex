    \begin{multicols*}{1}
        \section*{Agents}
            \textbf{Rational:} Maximally achieving goals (actions that maximize utility function) \\
            \textbf{Reflex Based:} Chooses action based on current percept (no future consideration)\\
            \textbf{Goal Based:} Chooses action based on consequences (model of how the world reacts)\\
            \textbf{Utility Based:} Goal based with trading off of multiple goals and uses probabilities
        \section*{Search}
            \textbf{Def:} Possible states, Successor function $f(n) \to$ ($n'$, action, cost), start and goal state\\
            \textbf{Complete:} Guaranteed to find a solution if one exists\\
            \textbf{Optimal:} Guaranteed to find the least cost path\\
            \textbf{Properties:} n$ =$ number of states, b$ =$ maximum branching factor, $C^*$$ =$ optimal cost, d$ =$ depth of shallowest solution, m$ =$ max depth, $\epsilon =$ min cost of all actions\\
            \textbf{Conformant Planning:} Set of actions that always work (sterilizing surgical gear)
        \section*{Blind Search}
            \textbf{DFS:} Fringe uses a Stack, complete iff finite, not optimal, time: O(b$^{m}$), space: O(bm)\\
            \textbf{BFS:} Fringe uses a Queue, complete, optimal (constant), time and space: O(b$^{d}$)\\
            \textbf{IDDFS:} Fringe uses a Stack, complete, optimal (constant), time: O(b$^{d}$), space: O(bm)
        \section*{Heuristic Search}
            \textbf{Heuristic $h(n)=$} An estimate of how close a state is to a goal\\
            \textbf{Admissible:} Always an underestimate to the true lowest cost\\
            \textbf{Consistent:} Always $h(n) <= h(n') + stepCost(n')$ where n' is a neighbor of n\\
            \textbf{Best First:} Fringe uses a PriorityQueue with cost fuction for each node\\
            \textbf{Uniform Cost:} Best First with $f(n)=$ sum of edge costs from  start to n (explores increasing contours), complete, optimal, time and space: O($b^{\frac{C^*}{\epsilon}}$)\\
            \textbf{Greedy:} Best First with $f(n)= h(n)$ (suboptimal goal is common)\\
            \textbf{A$^*$:} Best First with $f(n)= g(n) + h(n)$ with $g(n)=$ sum of costs from start to n\\
            \textbf{IDA$^*$:} Depth bound is now $F_{limit} = h(start)$, prune if $f(n) > F_{limit}$,\\ $F_{limit}' = min(pruned\ nodes)$, uses space of DFS, time depends on \# of unique F values\\
            \textbf{Beam:} Best First with $|Fringe| = K$, not complete, time: O($b^d$), space: O($b + K$)\\
            \textbf{Hill Climbing:} Always choose best child (Beam Search with K = 1)\\
            \textbf{Tabu:} Keep fixed length queue of states to not visit again (use with hill climbing)\\
        \section*{Stochastic Search}
            \textbf{Hill Climbing++ Restarts:} Generate random state when plateaued\\
            \textbf{Hill Climbing++ Walk:} With prob $p$ move to the neighbor with largest value, with $(1 - p)$ move to a random neighbor\\
            \textbf{Hill Climbing++ (Both):} Greedy move, random walk, or random restart\\
            \textbf{Simulated Annealing:} Pick a random neighbor and calculate the change in `energy' or objective function $\delta$, if it is positive then move to that state. Otherwise, move to this state with probability $e^\frac{\delta}{T}$ where T is decreased as the algorithm runs longer. High T $\to$ probability of bad move is higher and vice versa\\
            \textbf{Genetic:} Start with a population of random states, use an evaluation (fitness) function, produce next generation using random selection / crossover / random mutation\\
            \textbf{Gradient Descent:} Move in the direction of the gradient at each step
        \section*{Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)}
            \textbf{Def:} Goal test is a set of constraints over the state's variables $x_i$ $\in D_i\ or\ D$\\
            \textbf{Constraint Graphs:} Nodes are variables, (multi)edges show constraints\\
            \textbf{As Search Problem:} States defined by the values assigned so far, initially empty, Successor function assigns a value to an unassigned variable, and the Goal test checks to see if the current assignment is complete and satisfactory\\
            \textbf{Improvements:} Fix ordering with variable assignments, check constraints as you go\\
            \textbf{Forward Checking:} Cross off values that violate a constraint when added to the existing assignment (Immediate neighbors and fail if the set of possible values is empty)\\
            \textbf{Arc Consistency:} An arc $X \to Y$ is consistent iff for every x in the tail there is some y in the head which could be assigned without violating a constraint\\
            \textbf{Constraint Propagation:} If X loses a value, neighbors of X need to be rechecked\\
            \textbf{Min Remaining Values:} Choose the variable with fewest legal values in its domain\\
            \textbf{Max Degree:} Choose the variable in the most constraints with remaining variables\\
            \textbf{Least Constraining Value:} Given a variable, assign a value that rules out the fewest values in remaining variables\\
            \textbf{Rationale:} Want to enter most promising branch, but detect failure quickly. MRV and MD choose the variable most likely to cause failure while LCV ensures that an early value choice does not cause failure later
